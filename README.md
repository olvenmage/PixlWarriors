2D based indie game, all build in java


A little project that started with me just doing it to learn more about Java. 

It's going to be a 2d, adventure, turn based rpg, rogue-like.
I know, a lot of categories, I'm looking to create a fun, lasting, replayable experience.
My coding skills in Java aren't optimal, so if you feel the need to fork etc, feel free to!

A friend of mine is making sounds, I've got an other friend who can make sprites but I'm not too sure on that yet.
Contribution is always appreciated!
